Not only did she change my relationship with yoga but she changed my relationship with exercise in general. Over the past 2+ years, I have seen a huge difference in the way I move, my posture and my mental wellbeing. Her classes have always been professional with a personal touch. Her personality is electric and you will feel instantly at ease. During her classes, she has always been attentive with her students and I’ve also really appreciated her adjusting my poses and making sure that they are correct so I wouldn’t strain any muscles. As a beginner yogi, that has been super important to me, knowing I’m in the correct pose and in a safe place. In the past, I’ve been afraid of not being able to achieve the “perfect IG pose” but there is never any judgment nor ego in her class and everyone is on their own yoga journey. Her signature glow flow is a perfect mix of a little bit of every aspect of yoga. Aside from her signature Glow Flow, I would also highly recommend her Immersive Glow Flow Classes and as the name suggests, you are completely immersed in the lesson from the moment you smell the burning of Palo Santo. Visually you will be transported to a different space but it’s her teaching that makes it so unique. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced yogi, she can help you improve and reach your personal goals. I cannot recommend Nina Park enough - you will not be disappointed with any class you join!</p></div></div></div><div class="testimonial__signature"><div class="testimonial__name">Christine GY Lee</div><div class="testimonial__name-details"><div class="text-size-small">Hong Kong - 30 years old</div><div class="text-size-small">Private Lessons / Immersive Glow Experience / Outdoor / Virtual </div></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="swiper-slide w-dyn-item"><div class="testimonial__quote"><blockquote class="text-style-quote">She is a gifted yoga teacher who leads fluid flow sequences</blockquote></div><div class="testimonial__body"><div class="margin-medium margin-vertical"><div class="w-richtext"><p>Nina is one of the reasons why I fell in love with yoga all over again!

I have been active in sports all my life and still Nina taught me something new about how the body works in every class. Nina is very intelligent and it shows in the way she teaches yoga to her students: her classes are well structured with eye for detail, including aromatherapy, sounds and music and finishing classes with inspiring “food for thought”. She pays attention to all her students in every pose, trying to make us become a better version of ourselves without ever pushing us too hard. She taught me to really listen to my body and let go of my ‘ego’ during a workout. Her classes are both calming and energizing.

I can say that I am fully healing and I have continued with private lessons.

To this day, I am thoroughly enjoying the Zoom yoga class by Nina Park. She gives her full attention and energy to each class, not only teaching the yoga moves but also explaining why we are doing certain moves so that we can learn to pay attention to our bodies and become aware of how to improve our body and overall health.  Nina is not only a great teacher, but she is also a life-long learner who seeks to try new techniques and incorporates meridian yin/yang principles to her yoga practices. I love how she closes each yoga session with sharing different inspirational poems or readings to foster a positive outlook in life so her yoga practice has transformative power to improve your yoga practice as well as your overall lifestyle toward a balanced and healthy life. Nina brings deep learning, compassion, and joy to her class everyday. Since I started taking Nina’s yoga class, my posture has improved and my back pain is gone.

And Nina always encourages me to be curious and explore different postures. The quotes or readings at the end of the class always show positive encouragement and the feeling of ultimate relaxation. I always feel peaceful and rejuvenated after class. I am pleased to have found Nina’s class.</p></div></div></div><div class="testimonial__signature"><div class="testimonial__name">Angel Chan</div><div class="testimonial__name-details"><div class="text-size-small">Hong Kong - 40 years old </div><div class="text-size-small">Yoga Bagel Studio / Outdoor Yoga / Immersive Glow Experience</div></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="swiper-slide w-dyn-item"><div class="testimonial__quote"><blockquote class="text-style-quote"> Her voice is captivating, guidance is clear, and approach is both refreshing and unique</blockquote></div><div class="testimonial__body"><div class="margin-medium margin-vertical"><div class="w-richtext"><p>I’ve been fortunate enough to learn from many gifted yoga teachers across New York, Seattle, Hong Kong, and Bali. However, Nina has been the only teacher to make me feel completely relaxed and connected with my practice. Her voice is captivating, guidance is clear, and approach is both refreshing and unique. Her selection of music, which is newly curated for each class, blends in perfectly with each sequence and her incorporation of aromatherapy fully awakens the senses. Above all, I truly appreciate her genuine desire to help each of her students improve. She is truly a special teacher and individual and I recommend everyone to try her classes.</p></div></div></div><div class="testimonial__signature"><div class="testimonial__name">Jonathan Chien </div><div class="testimonial__name-details"><div class="text-size-small">Hong Kong - 29 years old </div><div class="text-size-small">Private Lessons / Yoga Bagel Studio / Outdoor Yoga / Immersive Glow Experience </div></div></div></div></div></div><a href="#" class="testimonial__load-button w-inline-block"><div class="w-embed"><svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 54 54">
