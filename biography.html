Nina has been practicing and observing the science of yoga since 2006. Initially practicing yoga as a form of exercise and stress relief, Nina quickly realized that the practice far exceeded her expectations. It was the ancient texts, philosophies and science behind consciousness and awareness that linked to a deeper awareness of self that made her fall in love with being on the mat and finding home.</p><p>Born and raised in New York, Nina observed her father Yeon Hwan Park, the first US Taekwondo Olympic Team Head Coach and followed in his footsteps. She started practicing Taekwondo at the age of 3 and began competing very young - quickly becoming a poomse champion and instructor, eventually retiring her career with a 3rd degree black belt. During the same time she was also performing and landing commericals and modeling gigs in NYC.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-scroll-section="1" class="section-bio-career"><div class="page-padding"><div class="container-large"><div class="max-width__80-c"><blockquote class="text-style-quote">&#x27;Touching people’s lives, one posture, one breath, one vibration at a time’. </blockquote></div><div class="bio-career__layout"><div class="bio-career__left-col"><div class="w-richtext"><p>At 15 years old, Nina was invited to move to Los Angeles and continued a career as an accomplished actress, singer, dancer, and model in Hollywood - landing popular TV shows on Disney and Nickelodeon. Scouted by top South Korean record labels, she eventually signed with Yedang Entertainment (now Banana Culture Entertainment) and moved to Seoul, Korea to pursue a career in K-Pop where she wrote, composed, and co-produced her debut album ‘Hit’M, opening for Mariah Carey’s World Tour and starring in her own reality TV show.</p><p>In 2019 Nina humbly accepted a calling in servitude, and was inspired to become a dedicated yoga educator, completing her 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training at The Collective - Desa Seni School of Yoga in Bali, Indonesia. Under the tutelage of her beloved teacher, Bernd Windhofer, student of AG Mohan, disciple of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya (aka “the father of modern yoga”). Nina subsequently began teaching in Hong Kong and quickly became recognized for her energy, enthusiasm, and creativity - frequently referenced across various media outlets and, most notably, in TATLER HK as “the go-to yoga teacher for a dynamic class”.</p></div></div><div class="bio-career__right-col"><figure class="bio-career__image"><img src="62cf14618951bb43f802b88c/62db9e1ae3de790c868e57e4_Glow%20Flow%20Yoga%20by%20Nina2.jpg" data-scroll-position="top" data-scroll-delay="0.5" alt="" data-scroll-speed="1" data-scroll="1" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 87vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 35vw, (max-width: 1439px) 34vw, (max-width: 1919px) 31vw, 559px" loading="lazy" srcset="62cf14618951bb43f802b88c/62db9e1ae3de790c868e57e4_Glow%20Flow%20Yoga%20by%20Nina2-p-500.jpg 500w, 62cf14618951bb43f802b88c/62db9e1ae3de790c868e57e4_Glow%20Flow%20Yoga%20by%20Nina2-p-800.jpg 800w, 62cf14618951bb43f802b88c/62db9e1ae3de790c868e57e4_Glow%20Flow%20Yoga%20by%20Nina2-p-1080.jpg 1080w, 62cf14618951bb43f802b88c/62db9e1ae3de790c868e57e4_Glow%20Flow%20Yoga%20by%20Nina2.jpg 1242w"></figure></div></div></div></div></section><section data-scroll-section="1" class="section-bio-end"><div class="page-padding"><div class="container-large"><div class="max-width__80-c"><blockquote class="text-style-quote">“the go-to yoga teacher for a dynamic yoga class.”</blockquote></div><div class="bio-career__layout"><div id="a-scroll-rail" class="bio-career__left-col"><div class="w-richtext"><p>Nina passes down the philosophies and knowledge she has gained from her beloved teachers, interwoven with her own personal experiences and expressions of the practice to nurture connection with self and others. Merging her unique backgrounds as a former Taekwondo champion and K-Pop Recording Artist / Composer &amp; Songwriter, Nina founded the<em> ‘Glow Flow Yoga by Nina Method&#x27;</em>, designed to fully promote connection of mind, body, and spirit through a fun and intelligently sequenced flow with instruction that considers proper muscle activation, spinal alignment, flexibility, mental focus, and most importantly breath - bridging ancient practices of yoga and martial arts with pilates structural alignment.</p><p>Known for her versatility, Nina’s classes range from an invigorating and inspiring signature &#x27;Vinyasa Glow Flow&#x27;, to deeply relaxing and introspective practices of Yin and Restorative yoga. Her background in music production and live performance on stages around the globe, Nina curates a unique soundtrack for each class. In Hong Kong, Nina founded ‘The Immersive Glow Experience’ which included a multi-media/multi-directional visual experience, using 360 degree digital projection mapping technology. After living in Hong Kong and traveling Asia for three years, she moved to Seattle two years ago continuing on the path to ignite and inspire new and veteran students to the magic of yoga.</p><p>Whilst in Seattle, Nina started bridging all of her life&#x27;s paths and is now a Sound Bath Practitioner/Facilitator, offering the healing art of vibrational therapy and meditation, curating soundscapes - integrating quartz crystal singing bowls, tibetan sound bowls and various instruments with her vocals. As an active and devoted yoga educator, she currently teaches classes at Mind.Body.Hum in Seattle&#x27;s downtown district and also offers one-on-one lessons - providing recovery and healing therapies to help priate clients manage, recover, and heal from hip, knee and spinal injuries - including spinal protrusions/stenosis, herniated discs, sciatica etc. using Yoga Therapy, Intuitive Bodywork, Acupressure, and Energy Healing practices.</p><p>Nina’s intention and mission is to help individuals learn how to create more space within to authentically express themselves externally. In helping others release resistance and shift internal space, she believes it will positively help the way humans relate to and experience the world. Nina wishes to see everyone thrive, making yoga and all its counterparts impactful and accessible to everyone - &#x27;Touching people’s lives, one posture, one breath, one vibration at a time’.</p></div></div><div data-w-id="b05ca38f-16ed-bb1d-c384-b9472ec7235e" class="bio-end__right-col"><a data-w-id="96361183-4a79-2148-f011-a4ea09c58500" href="classes.html" class="bio-cta w-inline-block"><div class="bio-cta__circle">Explore<br>Nina’s classes</div><div id="explore-classes-circle-type" class="bio-cta__circle-type">Focus • Heal • Relax • Strengthen • Balance • Focus • Heal • Relax • Strengthen • Balance • </div></a></div></div></div></div></section><div data-scroll-section="1" class="page-footer"><div class="page-padding"><div class="container-large"><div data-w-id="cd028b93-7356-3c9f-1e94-19974bf700b3" class="footer__layout"><div>© Yoga by Nina LLC</div><a href="#" class="footer-scroll w-inline-block"><div class="w-embed"><svg version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" viewbox="0 0 47 64">
